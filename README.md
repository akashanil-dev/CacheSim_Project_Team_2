# **CacheSim – Cache Mapping & Replacement Algorithm Simulator**

### *Team Project for MCA 2025–27, Amal Jyothi College of Engineering*

---

## **📌 Project Overview**

**CacheSim** is a simulation tool that models the working of cache memory through different **mapping techniques** and **replacement algorithms**.
This project brings together concepts from:

* **24MCAT103 – Digital Fundamentals & Computer Architecture**
* **24MCAT107 – Advanced Software Engineering (Git Collaboration)**

The goal is to design a functional cache simulator while using Git for structured, collaborative software development.

## **🧠 Implemented Features**

### **1️⃣ Cache Mapping Techniques**

* Direct Mapping
* Fully Associative Mapping
* Set–Associative Mapping

### **2️⃣ Cache Replacement Algorithms**

* FIFO (First-In First-Out)
* LRU (Least Recently Used)
* LFU (Least Frequently Used)

### **3️⃣ Simulation Capabilities**

* Accepts a sequence of memory block references
* Shows cache content after each reference
* Computes hits, misses, and hit ratio
* Provides step-by-step replacement decisions

## **👥 Team Members, Branches & Assigned Algorithms**

Each member works on their **respective branch**, implementing **one** cache mapping or replacement algorithm.

| Team Member       | Branch Name | Assigned Algorithm (One Per Member) |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Akash A**       | `akash`     | FIFO                                |
| **Akshai Raj**    | `akshai`    | LRU                                 |
| **Aleena Roby**   | `aleena`    | LFU                      |
| **Albin Suresh**  | `albin`     | Direct Mapping           |
| **Alfiya Ismail** | `alfiya`    | Set Associative Mapping           |

> Choose from: **Direct Mapping**, **Associative Mapping**, **Set-Associative**, **FIFO**, **LRU**, **LFU**
> (Each member must take exactly one.)

## **🌿 Git Collaboration Workflow**

The project follows a structured Git workflow:

* Each member develops in **their own branch**.
* Frequent and meaningful commits.
* Merges done only after testing and review.
* Conflicts resolved collaboratively through teamwork.
* Documentation of Git logs, branches, merges, and contribution graph stored in `/screenshots`.
