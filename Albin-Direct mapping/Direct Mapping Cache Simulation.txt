# Direct Mapping Cache Simulation

**Overview**

This module implements a Direct Mapping Cache Simulation as part of the Cache Memory Mapping project. Direct mapping is a cache organization technique where each memory block is mapped to exactly one cache line using a fixed mapping function.

**Mapping Function**

The cache line for a given memory block is calculated using the formula:

Cache Line Index = (Memory Block Number) % (Number of Cache Lines)


Each cache line can store only one memory block. If multiple memory blocks map to the same cache line, a conflict miss occurs.

**Features**

Simulates Direct Mapping cache technique

Accepts a sequence of memory block references as input

Displays cache content after each memory access

Tracks total cache hits and misses

Calculates cache hit ratio

**Input**

Number of cache lines

Sequence of memory block references

**Output**

Cache state after each memory reference

Hit or miss for each access

Total number of hits

Total number of misses

Cache hit ratio

**Assumptions**

Cache initially empty

One memory block per cache line

Input references are block numbers (not byte addresses)

**Educational Purpose**

This simulation helps in understanding:

Fixed mapping behavior in direct mapping

Conflict misses

Trade-off between simplicity and cache performance
