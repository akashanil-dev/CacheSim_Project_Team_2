Input number of cache lines (N)
Initialize cache with N empty entries
hits = 0, misses = 0

Input sequence of memory block references

FOR each block in sequence:
    index = block MOD N

    IF cache[index] == block:
        hits = hits + 1
        result = "HIT"
    ELSE:
        misses = misses + 1
        cache[index] = block
        result = "MISS"

    Display cache status and result

hit_ratio = hits / total_references
Display hits, misses, hit_ratio
STOP
